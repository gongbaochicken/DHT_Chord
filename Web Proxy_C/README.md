# Web Proxy

### Date: Jan, 2015

This is a simplified project about designing a web proxy in C++. I wrote this code is to apply the skills I learned from lectures. This project is devided into 2 parts. The first part is a proxy without cache, while the second part adds cache and other functions.

### Part 1. Web Proxy without Cache

This part is an individual project, implementing a light-weighted HTTP/HTTPS proxy that lies between the browser and Internet servers.

Here is an instructions of compiling:

Firstly, please set the browser to access Internet by using manul proxy configuration. Para: HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1, Port:[your port]. I recommend Firefox to finish the configuration, which could be much easier than you expect. 

Then open your terminal, unix shell or git bash to compile the code. 
> cd simplified version

> make

Then run:
> ./proxy [your port]

Please use the brower to check if the simplified-version proxy can work as normal.

### Part 2. Web Proxy with Cache
This is a project that I cooperated with Wenquan Xing, who was a Duke fellow student and is a software developer in Amazon now.
